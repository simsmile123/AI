# TJHSST Artificial Intelligence 2021 - 2022

My artificial intelligence class created my passion for  Computer Science. We used Python as our coding language. The course began with hands-on exercises on platforms like CodingBat, providing a strong foundation for programming. We had a variety of projects, ranging from crafting one-line regular expressions to developing an AI that adeptly solved crosswords and mastered the strategic nuances of Othello. <br>

We also worked on neural network projects, offering practical insights into machine learning and deepening our understanding of artificial intelligence. The combination of theoretical concepts and real-world applications, such as the crossword-solving AI and Othello-playing agent, highlighted the dynamic nature of AI. <br>
