# TJHSTT Artificial Intelligence 2021 - 2022

My artificial intelligence class created my passion for  Computer Science. We used Python as our coding language. The course began with hands-on exercises on platforms like CodingBat, providing a strong foundation for programming. The diversity of projects was a standout feature, ranging from crafting one-line regular expressions to developing an AI that adeptly solved crosswords and mastered the strategic nuances of Othello. <br>

The class delved into neural network projects, offering practical insights into machine learning and deepening our understanding of artificial intelligence. Our remarkable teacher, who served as an inspiring role model, fostered an engaging learning environment. The combination of theoretical concepts and real-world applications, such as the crossword-solving AI and Othello-playing agent, highlighted the dynamic nature of AI. <br>

This class not only honed our Python programming skills but also provided a holistic view of AI's potential across various domains. The experience, filled with challenging projects and guided by an exceptional teacher, left a lasting impression and fueled a passion for the limitless possibilities within the field of artificial intelligence.
